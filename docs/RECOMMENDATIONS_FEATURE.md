# User Data Processing for Recommendations Feature

## Overview

The recommendation system processes user mood data to provide personalized suggestions for improving mental health and team wellbeing. This feature analyzes mood patterns, identifies trends, and generates actionable recommendations tailored to each user's needs.

## Components

### 1. Recommendation Service (`src/utils/recommendationService.js`)

The core service that processes user data and generates recommendations.

**Key Features:**
- **Mood Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes historical mood data to identify patterns and trends
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates suggestions based on mood category (positive, neutral, negative)
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies improving, declining, or stable mood trends
- **Insights Generation**: Calculates mood stability, streaks, and best days
- **Priority Scoring**: Assigns priority levels to recommendations based on urgency

**Main Methods:**
- `processUserDataForRecommendations(userData)` - Main entry point for processing
- `analyzeMoodPatterns(moodHistory)` - Analyzes mood patterns
- `generateRecommendations(analysis, userData)` - Creates personalized recommendations
- `calculateMoodStability(moodHistory)` - Measures mood consistency
- `calculateStreaks(moodHistory)` - Tracks positive/negative mood streaks

### 2. Recommendation API (`src/utils/api/recommendationAPI.js`)

Mock API service that simulates backend endpoints for recommendations.

**Endpoints:**
- `getUserRecommendations(userId)` - Fetch recommendations for a user
- `getRecommendationHistory(userId, options)` - Get historical recommendations
- `markRecommendationCompleted(recommendationId, feedback)` - Mark as completed
- `skipRecommendation(recommendationId, reason)` - Skip a recommendation
- `getGroupInsights(groupId)` - Get team/group insights
- `updateRecommendationPreferences(userId, preferences)` - Update user preferences
- `getRecommendationStats(userId)` - Get user statistics

### 3. React Components

#### RecommendationCard (`src/components/RecommendationCard.jsx`)
- Displays individual recommendation with icon, title, and suggestions
- Shows priority level through color coding
- Expandable to show all suggestions

#### RecommendationsPanel (`src/components/RecommendationsPanel.jsx`)
- Main component for displaying recommendations and insights
- Shows mood insights dashboard with trends and stability scores
- Lists personalized recommendations
- Provides action buttons for viewing, customizing, and exporting

#### RecommendationsPage (`src/pages/RecommendationsPage.jsx`)
- Full-page view for recommendations
- Includes filters for time range and recommendation type
- Shows quick statistics and success metrics
- Links to additional resources and feedback

### 4. React Hook (`src/hooks/useRecommendations.js`)

Custom hook for managing recommendation state and API calls.

**Features:**
- Automatic data fetching
- State management for recommendations, insights, and statistics
- Action methods for completing, skipping, and managing recommendations
- Error handling and loading states

## Data Flow

1. **User Mood Data Collection**: User enters mood through the mood entry page
2. **Data Processing**: `recommendationService` processes mood history
3. **Analysis**: System analyzes patterns, trends, and correlations
4. **Generation**: Personalized recommendations are generated based on analysis
5. **Presentation**: Recommendations displayed in dashboard and dedicated page
6. **Interaction**: User can complete, skip, or provide feedback on recommendations
7. **Adaptation**: System learns from user feedback to improve future recommendations

## Recommendation Types

- **Activity**: Physical or mental activities to improve mood
- **Social**: Team and social interaction suggestions
- **Mindfulness**: Meditation and relaxation techniques
- **Support**: Resources for getting help
- **Recovery**: Steps for mood improvement
- **Motivation**: Encouragement for positive progress
- **Intervention**: Urgent support for declining moods
- **Group**: Team-based activities and support

## Priority Levels

Recommendations are assigned priority based on:
- **High Priority** (Red): Negative mood patterns or declining trends
- **Medium Priority** (Yellow): Neutral moods or stable patterns
- **Low Priority** (Green): Positive moods or improving trends

## Integration Points

### Dashboard Integration
- Summary card showing top 2 recommendations
- Quick link to full recommendations page
- Full recommendations panel below main content

### Navigation
- Added "Recommendations" menu item in sidebar
- Route: `/recommendations`
- Icon: Lightbulb (fas fa-lightbulb)

### Router Configuration
- Route added to `App.js`
- Component: `RecommendationsPage`

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Using the recommendation hook in a component
import useRecommendations from '../hooks/useRecommendations';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    recommendations, 
    insights, 
    loading,
    completeRecommendation 
  } = useRecommendations('user-1');

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Your Mood Score: {insights.averageMood}</h2>
      {recommendations.map(rec => (
        <div key={rec.id}>
          <h3>{rec.title}</h3>
          <button onClick={() => completeRecommendation(rec.id)}>
            Complete
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing the Feature

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: View recommendation summary cards
2. **Click "View All Recommendations"**: Opens full recommendations page
3. **Use Sidebar Navigation**: Click "Recommendations" menu item
4. **Interact with Recommendations**: View insights, filter recommendations, export data
5. **Check Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real backend API integration
- [ ] Machine learning for improved recommendations
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Integration with calendar for activity scheduling
- [ ] Push notifications for time-sensitive recommendations
- [ ] Detailed analytics dashboard
- [ ] Custom recommendation templates
- [ ] Integration with wellness apps and wearables

## Configuration

The system uses mock data for demonstration. In production:
1. Replace mock API with real backend endpoints
2. Implement authentication for user-specific data
3. Add environment variables for API configuration
4. Set up proper error logging and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

- Recommendations are cached to reduce API calls
- Lazy loading for historical data
- Debounced search and filter operations
- Optimized re-renders using React hooks

## Security Considerations

- User data should be encrypted in transit and at rest
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before display
- Follow HIPAA compliance for health-related data

## Support

For questions or issues related to the recommendations feature:
- Check the console for error messages
- Review the mock data in `recommendationAPI.js`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify routing configuration in `App.js`
